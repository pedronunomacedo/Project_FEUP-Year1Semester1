<p>It all started with an email from Karen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that time, Karen was our gift officer for the Ophthalmology 
department at the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s College of 
Medicine. I was a recently-hired junior prospect researcher and report 
writer at the University of Nebraska Foundation. For the first few 
months, I got the hang of routine work — prospect profiles, contact 
lists and the occasional statistical analysis. But I wanted to pursue 
more challenging work. I am a natural self-teacher and had begun to 
experiment with the R programming language. I was eager to find a 
project to further develop my data science skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, Karen sent me a doozy of a challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Could you find a list of people who have given to eye-related nonprofits?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, I was flummoxed. How would I find that kind of information,
 and for such a narrow philanthropic interest? Further, this question 
raised an even bigger challenge common to many nonprofits: How do we 
prospect for community needs beyond natural constituencies like alumni 
or patients, or needs that have no natural constituencies? Rather than 
brush off Karen’s request, I resolved to find the answer. I had no idea 
that my search for a solution would lead me to the world of text 
analytics.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finding the Data</h2>
<p>Before undertaking the project, I had a discussion with my 
supervisor, Jessie Rader, about the possibilities of a prospect 
interests project. She was immediately supportive and suggested I 
broaden its scope beyond Ophthalmology. The University of Nebraska 
system has several independent research institutes and museums that 
would benefit from a project like this.</p>
<p>My first task was determining if this project was even possible. 
Where would I find data on individual charitable giving? Fortunately, 
our sales contact at Blackbaud informed me about the NOZA database the 
company had acquired several years earlier. NOZA is an online database 
of charitable gift information derived from publicly-available sources. 
After getting buy-in from our head of prospect research, we purchased a 
screening on all assigned prospects and suspects who were previously 
identified by wealth screening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple weeks later, the data was in my hands. If you aren’t 
familiar with NOZA data, the result set comes back with, among other 
data, a link to the source of the gift information, such as a news 
release or an annual report. I took a sample of the largest supposed 
gift amounts and spot-checked sources for accuracy. With the exception 
of a single entry, the data was accurate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I inspected the charity type coding. The dataset Blackbaud 
provides contains coding that describes each charity’s mission in broad 
terms, such as “Arts and Humanities.” I decided the charity type coding 
was not granular enough for our needs — we needed more information about
 a prospect’s interests than they give to “Arts and Humanities.” With 
this dataset verified for quality, I could proceed with the 
project.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Planning the Project</h2>
<p>The most important step in planning for a prospect interests tool was
 determining objectives early on. Who will use the end product? For what
 will the product be used? What form should it take? Making sure you 
define those answers before writing a single line code will save you 
much grief later on. You are less likely to meander aimlessly without 
producing results, or worse, producing work that goes unused by your 
stakeholders. It was helpful for me to write a project plan, roughly 
following the <a href="https://www.sv-europe.com/crisp-dm-methodology/#businessunderstanding" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">CRISP-DM guidelines</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this project, I defined the answers to the above questions as such:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who will use the end product?</strong> The prospect managers, who, at UNF, are responsible for identifying prospects and managing portfolios.</li>
<li><strong>For what will the product be used?</strong> The end product 
will be used for generating prospects for university needs that are 
narrow in scope and/or lack natural constituencies such as alumni.</li>
<li><strong>What form should that end product take?</strong> Prospects 
should have a descriptive, human-readable interest code that captures 
the suspected level of interest the prospect has in each philanthropic 
mission category. Each prospect can have more than one philanthropic 
interest code, but not more than one interest level for each 
philanthropic mission category.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pipeline</h2>
<p>With a plan in place, I needed to determine my tools and process. As 
stated before, the coding from the NOZA dataset did not provide the 
level of granularity I sought. I needed to identify an alternative data 
source for describing the charities our prospects gave to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best data source for describing a charity’s mission is the 
charity itself — specifically, its website. Using web scraping and text 
analytics, I could systematically categorize the charities through <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~shatkay/Course/papers/UIntrotoTopicModelsBlei2011-5.pdf" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">topic modeling</a>. Knowing what data I needed, I could now broadly define my data pipeline. A&nbsp;<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-build-a-simple-machine-learning-pipeline" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">pipeline</a>
 is an ordered chain of computer processes that will make the data 
suitable for analysis. I determined I needed to write code to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download webpages from each charity our prospects gave to and store those pages in folders — one per charity.</li>
<li>Once the scraping was complete, I needed to convert web pages from HTML to plain text.</li>
<li>Then, I would process the text, including removing symbols and numbers, to make it compatible with text analytics software.</li>
<li>Finally, I needed to pick a text analytics software package that 
would identify how the charities naturally cluster by topic.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Web Scraping</h2>
<p>The first step is getting the text data. After researching my 
options, I went with a piece of software outside of the R programming 
language.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">Wget</a>
 is a free, open-source program that allows you to systematically 
download files from the internet. Wget is operated via the command line,
 like an old DOS program. While programs such as wget have a slight 
learning curve, it was the only software I found at the time that fit my
 needs precisely. Needless to say, I spent much of my time Googling 
Stack Overflow!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I required software that would allow me to not just scrape 
efficiently, but also ethically. There are certain ethical concerns you 
must follow when undertaking a scraping project.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Respect the website owner’s wish to not be scraped:</strong>
 Websites can use a file called “robots.txt” to tell software to not 
download its content. Wget has a setting that will ignore this file, but
 I recommend you don’t ignore it.</li>
<li><strong>Do not hammer websites with numerous automated requests:</strong>
 If a server notices you are sending multiple automated requests, the 
operator may perceive you as a threat and block your organization from 
the site. Wget allows you to limit the number of hits made on a site, 
randomize the time between hits, limit the download speed of each 
request and limit the amount of data downloaded. These settings make it 
less likely you will be blocked.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to ethical concerns, wget also allowed me to download all
 files on a site without knowing the file names beforehand. Wget will 
take a base URL, climb up and down the site’s directories and grab 
whatever is there. Lastly, wget lets you specify what types of files you
 want. In this case, I used a list of common file extensions for web 
pages, including .HTML, .HTM and .ASP.</p>
<p>Once I figured out wget, I wrote my first piece of R code. My 
function called wget using my desired settings and looped over the list 
of charities our prospects gave to. Over all, there were around 5,500 
charities to scrape. Running on my MacBook, the scraping took two 
months. (I will address strategies for reducing this time later in the 
article.)&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Text Analysis</h2>
<p>When the scraping finally finished, I had about 5,000 folders on my 
hard drive with 9 GB of HTML. These files now needed to be loaded into R
 and processed. At the time, I used the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">tidyverse</a> packages to help systematically read the html files into memory. I used the&nbsp;<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=XML" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">XML package</a> to turn the HTML into plain text. There is a more modern package in the R ecosystem called&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">rvest</a> that could possibly do the same thing. However, the XML package worked for me at the time and is still actively developed.</p>
<p>When I finished the processing of the HTML into text, I merged each 
text file for each charity into one list of words per charity. That way,
 there would be one “bag” of words to analyze for each charity. This 
method of text analytics is called the “<a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-bag-words-model/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">bag of words</a>”
 method. When using this simple method, you just need the words of your 
text. There is no need to preserve the word order, capitalization or 
punctuation. In addition to making the words all lowercase and removing 
punctuation, I also removed all numbers and&nbsp;<a href="http://text-analytics101.rxnlp.com/2014/10/all-about-stop-words-for-text-mining.html" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">stop words</a>
 (common words like “the” and “that”). Removing this from your analysis 
will help the algorithm focus on important, meaningful words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I had my dataset prepared, the fun began — modeling! I chose the&nbsp;<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/index.html" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">topicmodels</a> package from the CRAN repository. This package contains an implementation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/topicmodeling.html" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> (LDA) algorithm, which can be used for seeing how texts align with unlabeled topics. Kailash Awati published a&nbsp;<a href="https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/a-gentle-introduction-to-topic-modeling-using-r/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">non-mathematical tutorial</a> on both the algorithm and the topicmodels package that is immensely helpful.</p>
<p>One issue with this package is that you must pick a number of topics,
 or labelled clusters, before running the analysis. I experimented with 
25, 50 and 75 topics in each run. I eventually settled on the 50 topic 
model, as it struck the right balance between granular segmentation of 
charities and interpretability of topics. While the topicmodels package 
will not label topics for you, it will provide a list of words that are 
strongly associated with each topic. This helps to ascribe 
human-readable labels. For example, a topic that has words like “dogs,” 
“cats,” and “rescue” could be labeled as Animal Welfare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very satisfied with my results. While I did not get to the 
level of granularity I hoped for, the model was able to tell the 
difference between Protestant and Catholic organizations. It could also 
segment art museums, symphonies, community theaters, ballets and folk 
arts organizations into separate topics. However, it was not able to 
differentiate between zoos and botanical gardens. My assumption was that
 there were too few examples of gifts to those types of charities in my 
dataset.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Final Product</h2>
<p>With topic scores calculated for each topic, I now needed to devise a
 way to relate the topics to prospect giving behavior. For this stage, I
 collaborated with the prospect management team, as they were the 
intended users. Together, we created a rating system with three levels: 
Very Interested, Interested and Somewhat Interested. To qualify as “Very
 Interested” in a philanthropic interest, one had to give a gift over 
$100,000 (major gifts level), a planned gift, a capital gift or to 
multiple charities of the same interest and over multiple years. To 
qualify for “Interested,” one had to give to multiple charities of the 
same interest or over multiple years. To qualify for “Somewhat 
Interested,” a prospect needed to give at least one time to an interest.
 Those whose only gift was a memorial gift were not counted as 
“Interested.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took our rating system rules and created the logical expressions 
that would assign the interest levels to each individual. The final 
product had one row for each prospect, prospect interest and interest 
level rating.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Using the Ratings</h2>
<p>The initial impetus of the project was to find Ophthalmology 
prospects. Unfortunately, the data and the algorithm used did not give 
that level of granularity. I may experiment with more modern packages, 
such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/representation/word2vec" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">Word2Vec</a> or <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">GloVe</a>, to see if those algorithms can give the granularity I am after.</p>
<p>The work was still useful, though. One of the prospect interest types
 I discovered was Folk Arts. My team realized that prospects interested 
in Folk Arts philanthropy were excellent prospects for the Quilt Museum.
 The Quilt Museum was another difficult prospecting project my 
colleagues were engaged in. The museum did not have a natural pool of 
identifiable prospects to draw from, so this was a boon to our team’s 
efforts. In the near term, the team at UNF will also use the list to 
prospect for the&nbsp;<a href="https://buffettinstitute.nebraska.edu/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">Buffett Early Childhood Institute</a> and the <a href="https://waterforfood.nebraska.edu/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>In the course of my project, I learned important lessons. These tips 
will save you many headaches when you undertake your own data science 
project.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use Containerization Technology:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/containers/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">Containerization</a>
 is a technology that packages software libraries so a project can be 
run at any time, on any system, producing the same results. Packaging R 
or Python scripts with exact versions of libraries will enable 
consistent results, even if scripts are run years later. It will also 
increase the portability of your code. I ran into incompatibilities 
between the Mac OS and Windows versions of R when I tried to run my 
analysis on my work computer. Using containerization from the start 
would have saved me much grief. The most well-known containerization 
technology is Docker, but other alternatives are rkt, Apache Mesos and 
containerd.</li>
<li><strong>Use the cloud:</strong> I ran the web scraping from my home 
laptop, rather than tie up a machine at work. This meant my laptop was 
unusable for two months, to avoid crashing the computer while the script
 ran. If I repeat this, I will buy time on a cloud provider such as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">Google Cloud Platform</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">Microsoft Azure</a>, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">Amazon Web Services</a>. Their pricing is affordable and you can select the appropriately-powered machine for your use case.</li>
<li><strong>Use multiple threads:</strong> R is known for being 
single-threaded by default. This means it can only do one task at a time
 in order. This is opposed to multi-thread, where a program can use a 
computer’s multiple processing cores to do work in parallel. Since the 
time I first wrote my code, doing multi-threaded work in R has become 
much easier with the <a href="https://github.com/DavisVaughan/furrr" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true">furrr package</a>. I plan to eventually rewrite my code to use this package to make the web scraping go faster.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through the use of both screenings and analytics, it is possible to 
find prospects outside normal constituencies. The web and our own 
databases are full of text with valuable insights. Contact reports, news
 articles and pre-campaign feasibility interviews are good starts for 
dipping your toes into text analytics. With a thoughtful plan, buy-in 
from management and collaboration with stakeholders, your own text
